# TIME ZONE CONVERTER

When I created this program, I was undergoing a 12-month Software engineering training, designed for Anglophone African tech enthusiasts. Keeping to date and time was essential to succeed in the program and due to the variety of time zones between African countries, People began to miss deadlines and meetings. It was a little buggy problem.

## GETTING STARTED

The converter takes the user's time and converts it to the time of a selected country.Internet connection is required only for the opening the program on the web. JavaScript engine takes care of the rest :)

1. Open the program in any web browser of your choice.
2. Select the time you want to convert.
3. Select the timezone for the time in number 2 above.
4. Select the country you would like to convert the time to. For example, you would convert the time and timezone in numbers 2 and 3 respectively to that of the country you selected.
5. Press the convert button.
6. The converted time is displayed below the button.

## Warning

General Approach: The code uses a manual approach to time zone conversion, which may become error-prone during scale-up and does not account for all the complexities of time zone differences, such as daylight saving time changes.

## USE CASES

It's Monday, I just received a push notification on slack about a meeting scheduled to hold at 13:30 WET.
Holy sheet, what is WET? Panic Panic.
Panic no more brethren, the T-Z converter is here. Just select the name of your country and I would give you an accurate converted time.
