<i>I am currently undergoing a 12-month Software engineering training, designed to train African tech enthusiasts and keeping to date and time was necessary to succeed in the activity.</i>.

I noticed most African countries differed from each other based on timezone and this caused confusion and panic among some students. I decided to solve the problem by creating a solution that converts a given time to the time of a selected region.

Steps Taken to collect maximum nation of students:

1) Took a statistic from slack channels to determine the number of African students in the programme.

2) I researched how many african country speaks English(the programme was run in the English Language).

3) Did a mass posting on various channel to reach out any micro nationalist(one candidate from a nation may not be obvious ) who would like to indicate their country.



!!! The intensity of the training is forceful and it takes all my time. i am unable to complete this yet.... On hold!!
